Relational Databases organize structured data in a relational model, storing data as tables and organizing them using relationships.

## Why Should We Learn This?

1. **Most Matured**: Relational Databases are one of the oldest and most enduring database models, having survived and evolved through numerous changes in technology.
   
2. **SQL**: They provide a robust DSL query language (SQL) that offers great flexibility in data manipulation. SQL skills are highly transferable and widely used across various database technologies, making it a solid skill set for emerging fields like data science.

3. **Foundation**: Relational Databases can represent a wide range of data structures, including objects, documents, and time series, within a single framework. This versatility provides a strong foundation for applications, allowing them to start with a relational database and transition to specialty databases as needed.
